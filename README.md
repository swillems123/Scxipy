NBA Player Statistics Analysis
Overview
This script analyzes NBA player statistics data with focus on three-point shooting accuracy and statistical comparisons. It identifies the player with the most regular seasons played and performs detailed statistical analysis on their performance over time.

Features
Data Filtering: Isolates regular season NBA data
Career Analysis: Identifies the player with the most regular seasons played
Three-Point Accuracy: Calculates season-by-season three-point shooting accuracy
Regression Analysis: Performs linear regression on three-point accuracy over time
Statistical Integration: Calculates average three-point accuracy using mathematical integration
Interpolation: Estimates missing values for the 2002-2003 and 2015-2016 seasons
Descriptive Statistics: Computes mean, variance, skew, and kurtosis for Field Goals Made (FGM) and Field Goals Attempted (FGA)
Statistical Testing: Performs both paired and independent t-tests on FGM and FGA
Visualization: Generates a plot showing the player's three-point accuracy trend with regression line
Requirements
Python 3.x
pandas
numpy
scipy
matplotlib
Usage
Place your NBA dataset as 'data.csv' in the C:\HW\1\ directory (or update the file path in the code)
Run the script:
Output
The script prints comprehensive statistical information to the console and displays a plot showing the player's three-point accuracy trend over their career. The analysis includes:

Player with the most regular seasons played
Season-by-season three-point accuracy
Linear regression equation for accuracy trend
Integrated and actual average three-point accuracy
Interpolated values for missing seasons
Detailed descriptive statistics for FGM and FGA
Results of t-tests comparing FGM and FGA
The visualization shows both the actual three-point accuracy data points and the regression line.
